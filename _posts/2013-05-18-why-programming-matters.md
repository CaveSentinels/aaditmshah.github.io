The word _mathematics_ comes from the Greek word _máthēma_ which means _knowledge_, _study_ or _learning_. Maths is important. Dozens of people must have told you this dozens of times. As a little child you must have asked your parents and your teachers about why you must learn maths; and like most adults they must have replied, _"Maths is important."_

Then comes the inevitable reply from the mind of the inquisitive young child, _"Why?"_ This is followed by a series of reasons and explanations to justify the statement, ranging from _"You need to study maths to get a good job"_ to _"Maths is fun"_. Oftentimes adults are unable to convince children about the importance of maths because they aren't convinced themselves, and children sense this.

There are two contrasting characteristics here. Little children are inquisitive. They want to learn and know more, and hence perpetually trouble adults with the question _"why?"_ Children are mathetic. Most adults on the other hand are mathophobic - they develop a deep rooted fear towards learning. Particularly towards learning mathematical and scientific subjects.

## The Problem ##

We are all aware of the problem. Something is turning mathetic children into mathophobic adults. Parents send their children to school to learn and the child is expected to understand concepts that took mathematicians like Pythagoras and Archimedes a lifetime to discover, in just a few years. When children ask why they are expected to learn these concepts adults are unable to give satisfactory answers.

Children don't care about getting a good job. Children don't care that mathematical and scientific discoveries are the reason that they can enjoy watching cartoons on the television set; and children certainly do not think that maths is fun - especially when adults themselves know that solving maths equations is repetitive and boring. Giving children unsatisfactory answers makes them disinterested in the subject.

In order to learn a new concept both children and adults alike and need to be able to make some sense of it. People need to know why they must learn something before they can actually learn it. You may show a man how to fish but unless he understands why he must learn how to fish for himself, he'll never learn how to fish. Learning is a choice. People only learn when they want to learn.

The real problem however is the negative feedback children receive when they fail to understand a concept. When children fail to score a certain number of marks in a test adults usually subject them to criticism like _"How could you make such a silly mistake?"_  or _"Why don't you get as many marks as your friends?"_ Such negative criticism makes children less confident about themselves and they eventually develop an anxiety towards the subject and learning itself.

This anxiety is reinforced by adults by discriminating between children. Those who understand a particular concept easily are considered _bright_ students while those who don't understand it so easily (or don't understand it at all) are considered _dull_ students. This distinction stays with the children for the rest of their lives and its effects are very difficult to undo.

This problem continues to persist because society accepts it. Schools continue trying to teach children hard to grasp abstract concepts without giving a satisfactory answer as to why it's necessary to do so. Adults continue criticising children for getting low grades and consolidate their anxiety by discrminating between them; and these children eventually become adults themselves and continue the tradition.

__Summary:__

1. Schools try to teach children abstract concepts which are hard to grasp. (BetterExplained - [Learning To Learn: Pencil, Then Ink](http://betterexplained.com/articles/learning-to-learn-pencil-then-ink/ "Learning To Learn: Pencil, Then Ink | BetterExplained"))
2. Adults don't give satisfactory answers as to why children must learn something provoking their disinterest towards learning it.
3. Adults subject children to negative criticism which makes them less confident and more anxious towards learning.
4. Adults consolidate the anxiety of children towards learning by discriminating between students.
5. The problem has been assimilated into the structure of society as children become adults and continue the tradition.
